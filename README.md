The course introduces the machine learning principles and models, including basic theory of learning. 
### Project type: B
This repository contains our final project for the exam, composed of two distinct assignments:
- MONK: classification task using the (UCI's MONK problems dataset)[http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/MONK's+Problems]
- CUP: multivariable regression task using the CUP dataset given by course professor Alessio Micheli.
